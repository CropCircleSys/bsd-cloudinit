{"name":"bsd-cloudinit","tagline":"cloud-init scripts for BSD","body":"## bsd-cloudinit\r\nbsd-cloudinit is a Python script based on [cloudbase-init](https://github.com/cloudbase/cloudbase-init/) that do various tasks to prepare the FreeBSD instance for cloud environment.\r\n\r\n## Built image\r\nWe have [experimental built images](http://140.113.98.9/bsd-cloudinit/) available for download.\r\n\r\nYou can use the following command to upload the image to Glance:\r\n\r\n    glance image-create --name \"FreeBSD 9.2\" --disk-format qcow2 \\\r\n     --container-format bare < freebsd-9.2-fls-cloudimage-v1.img\r\n\r\n\r\nbsd-cloudinit will inject your SSH public key into the instance, just log in with username `freebsd`.\r\n\r\nThe root password is `fenglisu`.\r\n\r\n## Build a FreeBSD VM image for OpenStack\r\nbsd-cloudinit-installer is the VM image maker, it transforms a VM into a OpenStack VM image.\r\n\r\n### Install FreeBSD via virt-manager\r\nFirst you'll have to install a normal VM via virt-manager or similiar tools.\r\n\r\nWhen installing, the **root partition must be the last partition on the disk**, so that bsd-cloudinit could grow the partition on first boot.\r\n\r\nThere should be no need for SWAP. (there is no SWAP in the official Ubuntu cloud images either) But if you want SWAP, always make sure `/` is on the last partition.\r\n\r\n### Install required Python packages\r\n\r\n    pkg_add -r py27-distribute\r\n    rehash\r\n    easy_install eventlet\r\n    easy_install iso8601\r\n\r\n### VIRTIO\r\nChange `ada` to `vtbd` in `/etc/fstab`\r\n\r\n### Output to OpenStack console log\r\n\r\n    echo 'console=\"comsonsole,vidconsole\"' >> /boot/loader.conf\r\n\r\n### Bootloader menu delay\r\n\r\n    echo 'autoboot_delay=\"1\"' >> /boot/loader.conf\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nbsd-cloudinit is built by @pellaeon, @apua, @iblis17 from Information Technology Service Center\r\n of National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
